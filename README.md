# Probe request project

Wi-Fi probe requests collected in lab `sc6-61` at Brno Univ. of Technology and stored in both, CSV and PCAP (compatible with Wireshark or Scapy) files. The two [simple sniffers](https://gitlab.com/tbravenec/esp32-probe-sniffer) of probe pequests using ESP32 as a networking device with connected SD card as a storage were used at `position_1` and `position_2`.

SSIDs and part of mobile device's MACs are annonymized.
